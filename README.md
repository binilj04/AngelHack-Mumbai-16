### MusicOnVids Tool

 This is a repository which uses the HPE Haven OnDemand https://www.havenondemand.com/ API to generate the automatic background music for your videos. You just need to pass the YouTube URL and we'll extract the text, optimize it, applying sentimental analysis for the perfect sound based on the aggregation. Once, it is in process, you will get the unique Job ID and that will be recognized for the respective video. We directly fetch the API from HPE Haven OnDemad as Speech Recognition and Sentimental Analysis which do the job in ease inside the Python. At background, we used mysql database to store the respective Job ID along with the reference ID while the processing of the video using ffmpeg liberary https://ffmpeg.org/( A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video ). And, finally if your check the status is success, you can download your video as it's ready with the auto background music.
 
 Most of the people, technicians, etc. don't have enough time to manually do all the stuff of making its a awesome video with full flagged support of all the themes along with proper music. Even, if you see the many technical or non-technical videos on YouTube, they are explaining better, very helpful but it lags the proper background music. Sometimes, the composing of their proper match is not done. There are N number of tools present into the market. But, still require many manually crafting of the tasks. Hence, we decided to develop it and make it automatic in this cloud era of automation world. In the recent time, we'll do this for videos not just YouTube. Thank you.

## Feature Work
 
 We plan to develop this and improve on underderstanding the content of the videos using AI or Machine Learning plateforms.This will enable people to creat rich video content in a matter of minutes.  And, along with it we can do lot of interactive things and can provide the live stream interaction for live sounds in the background. The analytics module is HPE Haven OnDemand is a very powerful tool and the API's were very easy to work with which enables fast and reliable development. And, we'll add few more power into this project by explaoring other api's that will help us understand the content of the video better and hence provide an apt background music . Also, based on the video, it will calculate the confidence level and do more of congnitive computing.
